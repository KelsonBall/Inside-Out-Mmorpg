# Inside-Out-Mmorpg
A simple mmorpg where bots are first class citizens

"Simple mmorpg"

haha, get it?

## ..why?

A major problem in mmorpg design is how to handle bots. One solution would be to make the game about creating bots in the first place, and then market the game as a way to learn coding! We think that's pretty cool.

## ..how?

Gotta keep the actual development as simple as possible. The world will need to be simple, but interesting enough to play and with enough depth to make bot writing an engaging experience. 

The system will also need to be very well documented, to make bot writing accesable to new coders.

And the game will need to be playable by humans, so people who aren't coders might get interested enough in the game to start writing bots.

## Steps

 1. document the api
 1. test the api
 1. implement the api
 1. write a javascript client library
 1. write a simple web client to let humans play the game
 1. write python and c# client libraries
 1. provide a way for users to pay us cache money
 1. provide a way for users to host their bots and share their bots with each other
